      Hey! I'm Pat Findley, I'm currently a student at <a href="https://turing.io/">
      Turing School of Software and Design</a>. 
      I like to consider myself a "creator of non-tangible things", and aspiring
      optimist.
      My goal for my little nook of the internet is to creatively apply what I'm currently learning, have fun, and grow through experience!
