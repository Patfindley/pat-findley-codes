    Hey! I'm Pat Findley, I'm currently a student at <a href="https://turing.io/">
      Turing School of Software and Design</a>
    <br>
    I like to consider myself a "creator of non-tangible things", and aspiring
    optimist.
    <br> My goal for my little nook of the internet is to creatively apply what I'm currently learning, have fun, and learn through experience!
